        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <pre>
My name is Arhaan Memon, and I am a 10th grader with a passion for both academics and athletics. 
Balancing my time between the classroom and the basketball court, I strive to excel in everything 
I do. 

I have a deep love for basketball and am proud to represent my high school team as a player. 
The thrill of competition, the camaraderie with my teammates, and the lessons in perseverance 
and teamwork are experiences that have shaped who I am today. Every time I step onto the court, 
I am reminded of the importance of discipline, hard work, and determinationâ€”qualities that 
I apply not just in sports, but in every aspect of my life.

Beyond the basketball court, I have a strong passion for computer science and data analytics. 
The world of technology fascinates me, and I am constantly seeking to learn more about how 
it can be used to solve real-world problems. Whether it's coding a new application, analyzing 
data sets, or simply exploring the latest advancements in the tech industry, I am always 
eager to expand my knowledge and skills.

In the future, I aim to pursue a career in computer science, where I can combine my love for 
technology with my analytical skills to make a meaningful impact. I believe that the intersection 
of sports and technology offers unique opportunities, and I am excited to explore how data 
analytics can be used to enhance athletic performance and strategy.

As I continue my journey through high school, I am committed to growing both as a student 
and as an athlete. I believe that my experiences in both arenas will prepare me for the challenges 
ahead and help me achieve my goals. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you will join 
me as I continue to pursue my passions and make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.

If you would like to learn more about my projects, interests, or just connect, feel free to 
reach out through the contact page. I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, and 
discussions about basketball, technology, or anything in between.
