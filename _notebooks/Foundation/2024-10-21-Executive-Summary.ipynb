An example can be as in python and javascript, most of the coding is similar and the one of the main differences is the code to print the output. \n"

I’ve learned how to write code in different languages like Python and JavaScript, and I’m starting to understand how loops, functions, and variables work together to create programs. I’ve also worked on fun projects like games and data entry screens, which have helped me see how coding can be used in real-life situations. Even when I face tough problems, figuring out how to solve them makes me feel accomplished. Overall, coding has taught me how to think logically and be patient while working through problems."
