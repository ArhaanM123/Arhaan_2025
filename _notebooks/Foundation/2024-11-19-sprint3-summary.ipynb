    "# Frontend Understanding\n",
    "<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 9 30 02 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/783d0c5c-56cf-4027-92a7-37d4bdbd7cf6\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Interface Design\n",
    "- I learned that the frontend is what users interact with. For example, in \"Zoom N Guess,\" the image display, input fields for guesses, and the feedback sections are all part of the frontend. I worked on ensuring these elements were visually appealing and user-friendly.\n",
    "  - **Example**: I styled the \"Submit Guess\" button to have a hover effect and glowing borders, making it more engaging for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Updates\n",
    "- Using JavaScript, I made sure the feedback sections update instantly after a guess is submitted. This improved the user experience by providing real-time responses.\n",
    "  - **Example**: When a user submits their guess, the \"Your Guess\" and \"Your Explanation\" sections immediately show the input without needing to refresh the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Backend Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"734\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-12 at 12 06 35 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9df4f6d-59da-4c02-b5b2-0b291aed0e3d\">\n",
    "<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 1 38 30 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed63b882-5359-4fb6-acd8-27daffc2bd0b\">\n",
    "<img width=\"826\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 1 39 53 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08409158-66c4-46b0-805d-e53d65905a99\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Handling\n",
    "- The backend processes and manages the data submitted by users. For \"Zoom N Guess,\" this included storing user guesses and feedback in a database and retrieving them for display.\n",
    "  - **Example**: I understood how the backend takes the guess input and checks it against stored data (like the correct answer) before sending a response back to the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## APIs and Communication\n",
    "- The frontend and backend communicate through APIs. For instance, when a user submits their guess, the frontend sends a request to the backend API, which processes the data and sends a response.\n",
    "  - **Example**: I used `fetch()` in JavaScript to send data to a mock backend API and handled the response to display feedback on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How They Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "- The frontend collects data (like a guess or explanation) and sends it to the backend via an API.\n",
    "  - **Example**: When the \"Submit Guess\" button is clicked, the guess input is sent to the backend for processing.\n",
    "- The backend processes the data and sends a response back to the frontend.\n",
    "  - **Example**: If the guess is correct, the backend might send a success message, which is displayed on the frontend.\n",
    "- Together, they create a seamless experience where the user can interact with the app and get immediate feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenges and Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend Challenges\n",
    "- I struggled with making the feedback sections dynamically update without reloading the page, but I learned how to use event listeners and DOM manipulation effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend Challenges\n",
    "- Understanding how APIs handle requests and responses was challenging at first, but testing endpoints and seeing the data flow helped solidify my understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Takeaways\n",
    "- This project taught me the importance of how the frontend and backend rely on each other. The frontend ensures the user has a great experience, while the backend powers the logic and data processing behind the scenes.\n",
    "- By working on both aspects, I now better understand how real-world web applications function and how developers create dynamic, interactive websites.\n",
