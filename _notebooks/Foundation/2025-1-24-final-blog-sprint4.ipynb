    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog is about **Wellness Waypoints**, a program designed to help people find the nearest care centers (like hospitals or pharmacies) based on their injury and city. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Program?\n",
    "The program solves a simple problem: If you’re injured, where can you go for help? It finds the best places near you and shows them on a map. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Did I Work On?\n",
    "- I created the tools (backend) that store information about care centers.\n",
    "- I built features (frontend) that let users search for care centers and see them on a map.\n",
    "- I set up the database so it can be saved, backed up, and restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Input/Output Demonstrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens on the Website?\n",
    "Users can:\n",
    "1. Select an injury from a dropdown.\n",
    "2. Type in the name of their city.\n",
    "3. Click \"Go\" to see a list of care centers and their locations on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function FindLocations() {\n",
    "  const location = document.getElementById(\"location\").value.trim();\n",
    "  const place = document.getElementById(\"place\").value.trim();\n",
    "\n",
    "  const url = `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=${location}+in+${place}&format=json&addressdetails=1&limit=10`;\n",
    "\n",
    "  const response = await fetch(url);\n",
    "  const data = await response.json();\n",
    "\n",
    "  data.forEach((place, index) => {\n",
    "    const row = `<tr>\n",
    "        <td>${index + 1}</td>\n",
    "        <td>${place.display_name.split(\",\")[0]}</td>\n",
    "        <td>${place.display_name}</td>\n",
    "        <td>${place.lat}, ${place.lon}</td>\n",
    "      </tr>`;\n",
    "    document.querySelector(\"#resultsTable tbody\").innerHTML += row;\n",
    "  });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What This Does:** This code takes the user’s input, asks a website (API) for care center locations, and shows the results in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Postman\n",
    "Postman is a tool we use to test APIs. Here’s an example:\n",
    "- **Request to Add a Care Center:**\n",

    "    \"address\": \"123 Main St\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "## 3. Backend Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Care Center\n",
    "This code adds a new care center to the database:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@token_required\n",
    "def post(self):\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    if not all(key in data for key in [\"injury\", \"location\", \"address\"]):\n",
    "        return {\"message\": \"Missing required fields\"}, 400\n",
    "    center = CareCenter(**data)\n",
    "    center.create()\n",
    "    return jsonify(center.read()), 201\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What This Does:** It checks if all fields (injury, location, address) are provided and then saves the care center to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Queries\n",
    "We use Python to ask the database for information. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "centers = CareCenter.query.filter_by(location=\"Hospital A\").all()\n",
    "return jsonify([center.read() for center in centers])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What This Does:** It looks for care centers in \"Hospital A\" and sends the results back as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Working with Code (Algorithms)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling User Requests\n",
    "This function sends user data (like an injury) to the server and saves it:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function postCareCenterData(injury, location, address) {\n",
    "  const postData = { injury, location, address };\n",
    "\n",
    "  try {\n",
    "    const response = await fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/waypoints`, {\n",
    "      method: \"POST\",\n",
    "      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n",
    "      body: JSON.stringify(postData),\n",
    "    });\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(\"Failed to post data\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    const result = await response.json();\n",
    "    console.log(\"Successfully posted:\", result);\n",
    "  } catch (error) {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Error posting data:\", error);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What This Does:** Sends data to the backend and saves it. If there’s an error, it shows a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Challenges and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- Making the map update automatically.\n",
    "- Handling errors when the API doesn’t work as expected.\n",
    "- Debugging API responses to figure out what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "- Added better error messages for missing fields.\n",
    "- Made the database queries faster.\n",
    "- Improved how markers appear on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Addressing Learning Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teamwork:** Built features that connect the frontend and backend.\n",
    "- **Algorithms:** Used Python and JavaScript to manage user inputs, save data, and display results.\n",
    "- **API Testing:** Used tools like Postman to check how the backend handles requests.\n",
    "- **Database Management:** Created, backed up, and restored data using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Third-Party Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQLAlchemy:** Makes working with databases easier.\n",
    "- **Leaflet.js:** Displays care center locations on a map.\n",
    "- **OpenStreetMap API:** Provides location data based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Wellness Waypoints** project shows how coding can solve real-life problems. It connects users with care centers quickly and efficiently, making the program both useful and practical.\n"
