    "\n",
    "- Our goal is to create a budget-friendly travel planner that helps travelers find important resources, such as activities, hotels, restaurants, and healthcare facilities while they are away from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- My purpose is about **Wellness Waypoints**, a program designed to help people find the nearest care centers (like hospitals or pharmacies) based on their injury and city. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Program?\n",
    "The program solves a simple problem: If you’re injured, where can you go for help? It finds the best places near you and shows them on a map. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Did I Work On?\n",
    "- I created the tools (backend) that store information about care centers.\n",
    "- I built features (frontend) that let users search for care centers and see them on a map.\n",
    "- I set up the database so it can be saved, backed up, and restored.\n",
