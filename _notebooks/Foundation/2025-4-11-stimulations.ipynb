    "- A random algorithm is a set of steps in coding that uses chance or unpredictability to make decisions or create results. Instead of doing the same thing every time, it might choose a different path each time it runs. Random algorithms can be helpful in real-life coding for things like creating games, shuffling music playlists, or generating passwords. They make programs less predictable and more dynamic. The College Board might ask questions about how random algorithms work, when to use them, or how they affect the output of a program. They could also give code and ask you to figure out the possible outcomes.\n",
