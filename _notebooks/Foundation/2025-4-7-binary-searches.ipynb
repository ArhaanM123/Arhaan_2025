    "- ​In this project, I used Python's pandas library to handle a dataset of school supplies. After loading the data and removing any incomplete entries, I sorted the items by their prices. I then created a binary search function to quickly find specific prices within this sorted list. Using this function, I searched for the prices $1.25, $6.49, and $10.00, and displayed messages indicating whether each price was found in the dataset. This approach showcased how binary search can efficiently locate items in a sorted collection."
