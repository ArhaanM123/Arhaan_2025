    "Question:\n",
    "An algorithm can be used to solve an undecidable problem.\n",
    "- Answer: False\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- An undecidable problem is one that no algorithm can solve for every input. There might be some algorithms that work for some cases meaning that the problem remains undecidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popcorn Hack 2**\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "If a programmer encounters an undecidable problem, they can just use an algorithm that works most of the time.\n",
    "Answer: True\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Even though there's no perfect algorithm that works for all cases in an undecidable problem, programmers sometimes create algorithms that work for most inputs or give an answer within a time limit. It's a useful shortcut, even if it's not guaranteed to always be correct.\n",

    "Investigate and describe how modern operating systems and browsers handle infinite loops or excessively long-running scripts. What mechanisms are in place to detect and mitigate such issues? Provide real-world examples of these mechanisms in action, such as specific error messages, timeouts, or automated recovery processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Operating Systems Handle It**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task Manager (Windows)** and **Activity Monitor (Mac)** show what programs are using a lot of CPU or memory.\n",
    "- If a program freezes or runs forever, users can **\"End Task\"** or **\"Force Quit\"** it to stop the issue.\n",
    "- The OS might show a message like **\"Not Responding\"** to let you know something is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* If a game or app freezes, Task Manager lets you close it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Browsers Handle It**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Browsers like **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari** track how long scripts are running.\n",
    "- If a script runs too long, they stop it and show an error message like:  \n",
    "  _\"A script on this page is causing your browser to run slowly. Do you want to stop it?\"_\n",
    "- Browsers use **timeouts** to kill long-running code and **sandboxing** to isolate each tab so one crash doesn’t affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Chrome shows an **“Aw, Snap!”** error when a tab crashes, but the rest of the browser still works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools help protect users and systems from code that might never stop running. Even though **undecidable problems can't be solved** with a perfect algorithm, operating systems and browsers use **timeouts**, **crash handling**, and **user alerts** to keep things safe and running smoothly.\n",
